# Catto - Procrastination Time
My Progress as an iOS Developer Swift | SwiftUI

## Overview
Catto is a playful social app designed for moments of purr-crastination! Users can browse through an endless stream of adorable cat photos, add witty captions, and vote for their favorites. It's a fun and simple competition to discover the most creative or funniest caption, all while indulging in a love for cats.

This project has been a key part of my journey as an iOS Developer. Over time, I have restructured the app multiple times, experimenting with different approaches, and architectures. This repository documents my evolution and learning as an iOS Developer.

## Progress and Learning
The evolution of Catto reflects my growth as an iOS Developer, allowing me to:
- Improve understanding of architectures like MVVM.
- Better understanding of Class and Structure usages. 
- Delegate responsibilities effectively between view models.
- Gain a better understanding of @Environment and its usage in SwiftUI.
- Explore different approaches for data persistence.
- Implement gestures and enhance app interactivity.
- Migrate to SwiftUI and understand its declarative approach.
- Better structure the separation of responsibilities within the app.

  

## What's Next?
- Implement Unit Tests to ensure better code quality and stability.
- Improve data persistence (full implementation of SwiftData).
- Refine user interface.
- Authentication with Apple.
- Logic for vote comments and show the most voted on the top of the list. 
- Explore animations and transitions for a smoother experience.
