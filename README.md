<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

Catto is built using Swift and the SwiftUI framework to ensure a smooth and native iOS experience.<br/>
<strong>Architecture:</strong> The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation between the UI and business logic, making it scalable and easy to maintain.<br/>
<strong>Design System:</strong> I created a custom style guide called Miau, which helps in reusing components like fonts, colors, and UI elements consistently across the app.<br/>
<strong>API:</strong> The app fetches cat images from <a href="https://thecatapi.com"> The Cat API </a>, delivering fresh content for endless captioning fun.
